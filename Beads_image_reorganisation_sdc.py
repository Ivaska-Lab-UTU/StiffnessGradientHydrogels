"""
 Renames and reorganises tile scans acquired using a 3i Spinning Disk Confocal and SlideBook 
 software (exported as TIFFs). The original, repeating 'left to right, right to left' sequence
 is changed to 'left to right' only, compatible with Beads_quantification_sdc.ijm.
 
 Dec 2017: Nuria Barber-PÃ©rez wrote the original code.
 Apr 2020: Aleksi Isomursu converted to Python 3 (v3.7.7), modified the loop for reversing image
 order and added functionality for selecting a working directory via input prompt.
