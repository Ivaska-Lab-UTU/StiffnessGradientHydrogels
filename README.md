# StiffnessGradientHydrogels
A collection of short scripts for facilitating fluorescent bead quantification from multi-level tile scans. Used in conjunction with polyacrylamide-based stiffness gradients, see Barber-PÃ©rez et al. (doi.org/10.1101/775809) for more details.

1) Beads_image_reorganisation_sdc.py: a Python script for renaming and reorganising tile scans acquired using a 3i Spinning Disk Confocal system and SlideBook software.

2) Beads_quantification_sdc.ijm: an ImageJ macro that quantifies fluorescent beads from a multi-level (z stack) tile scan montage.

3) Beads_convert_to_matrix.py: a Python script for organising a list of image numbers and bead counts into a 2D matrix for easier visualisation and downstream analysis.
